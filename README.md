# Obsidian Tag File Explorer

The philosophy of this plugin is to sort and organize your notes based on a nested tag system. 
Until now, I've been sorting my files using, a normal folder hierarchy system. However overtime I've come to realize the limitations of such a folder based system.

One of the main shortcomings of organizing notes within physical folders is that many times individual notes need to be classified within multiple folders. For eg if a note contains the stock market status of the company Apple, then this note should be classified within both the "Stocks" folder as well as "Technology" folders. 

To solve this issue, we can use the nested tags functionality provided by obsidian. Individual notes can be assigned hashtags such as #tech, #stocks while more higher classification can be done as #economy/stocks or #science/tech/apple etc. 

The greatest benefit of this functionality is that individual notes can be assigned multiple separate tags at the same time. This means that the above example note can be tagged as "#science/tech/apple" as well as "#economy/stocks"
